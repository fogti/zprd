zprd v0.0.3
===========

setup:
------

 - compile zprd / installation
  mkdir -p build && cd build
  cmake .. && make -j3 && make install

 - setup /etc/zprd.conf (content; initial)
  Itun3

 - setup interface (this is usually done by the daemontools)
  ip tuntap add mode tun user ... tun3
  ip addr add .../24 dev tun3
  # MTU = base MTU (1500) - UDP (8) - IP (20)
  ip link set dev tun3 mtu 1472
  ip link set dev tun3 up

 - start zprd (this is usually done by the daemontools)
  ./zprd

NOTES
-----

 - The ZPRD ONLY establishes peer connections at startup.

 - The ZPRD manages incomming connections.

 - The ZPRD **doesn't encrypt** any data, as it is designed
   to have very less overhead. It is intended to be used
   in combination with VPN software.

 - The ZPRD tunnels IPv4 packets (and **ONLY IPv4** packets)
   over UDP and IPv4.

 -> protocol stacking:
    ethernet > ipv4 > udp > ipv4 > payload
