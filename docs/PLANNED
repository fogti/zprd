Overview:

  ZPRN || inner proto (e.g. IP*)
      ZPRD
  outer proto (e.g. IP* + UDP)

Done things:

  ZPRN:
   - PROBE before DELETE
     e.g. one node is outdated, first PROBE (when timeout) then DELETE (when timeout * 2)
     why: faster convergence

Planned Things:

  ZPRN:
   - compress ZPRN packets, (probably with new mgc = 0x01)

  inner proto:
   - possible support for multicasts (currently mostly blocked)
     - not broadcasts (they MUST be discarded, as they create a too high load on the network)
     - support for IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol)

   - possible support for IPX

  routing:
  - multi-route rand():
    e.g. switch between the first and second router for a destination randomly
         if both have near latency and equal hops
