Overview:

  ZPRN || inner proto (e.g. currently IPv4 + ...)
      ZPRD
  outer proto (e.g. currently IPv4 + UDP)

Planned Things:

  ZPRN:
   - possible: PROBE before DELETE
     e.g. one node is outdated, first PROBE (when timeout) then DELETE (when timeout * 2)

  inner proto:
   - support for IPv6, and other protos
     - 1. innner node's addr's
     - 2. header manip (e.g. r:src, r:dst, w:ttl, ...)

  outer proto:
   - support for IPv6, and other protos
     - 1. build datatype (struct { enum, char[X_MAX] }), consider saving PORT number, too
     - 2. used in router fn's, routing tables, ...
     - 3. used in read + sender
     - 4. socket
