Overview:

  ZPRN || inner proto (e.g. currently IPv4 + ...)
      ZPRD
  outer proto (e.g. currently IPv4 + UDP)

Done things:
  outer proto:
   - support for IPv6, and other protos -- done
   - Motivation:
     for port numbers in addr struct:
     - better support for NAT'ed networks

Planned Things:

  ZPRN:
   - possible: PROBE before DELETE
     e.g. one node is outdated, first PROBE (when timeout) then DELETE (when timeout * 2)
     why: faster convergence
   - ZPRNv2: compress ZPRN packets, (new mgc = 0x01)

  inner proto:
   - support for IPv6, and other protos
     - 1. build datatype (struct { enum, char[X_MAX] }), or use a class hierarchy
     - 2. innner node's addr's
     - 3. header manip (e.g. r:src, r:dst, w:ttl, ...)
     - 4. used in router fn's, routing tables, route_packet
     - 5. used in send_packet:in_checksum
     - 6. used in send_icmp_packet (needs to be conditional / implemented for other protos)
     - 7. build an abstraction layer (interface, multiple classes, virtual methods) around (1.)
