Overview:

  ZPRN || inner proto (e.g. currently IPv4/IPv6 + ...)
      ZPRD
  outer proto (e.g. currently IPv4/IPv6 + UDP)

Done things:
  outer proto:
   - support for IPv6
   - Motivation for port numbers in addr struct
     - better support for NAT'ed networks

  inner proto:
   - support for IPv6

  ZPRN:
   - PROBE before DELETE
     e.g. one node is outdated, first PROBE (when timeout) then DELETE (when timeout * 2)
     why: faster convergence

Planned Things:

  ZPRN:
   - ZPRNv2: compress ZPRN packets, (new mgc = 0x01)

  inner proto:
   - possible support for multicasts (currently mostly blocked)
     - not broadcasts (they MUST be discarded, as they create a too high load on the network)
     - support for IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol)

   - possible support for IPX
