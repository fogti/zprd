NOTE for zprd-0.1.2 - peer communication:

In this version, we silently register new clients, and we discard
them after a timeout (no data from peer since 10 minutes).

When we discard a client, we use the following algorithm:

 1. mark the client as discarded

 2. foreach route with a discarded client as router
    3. delete route
    4. send delete route notify packet (ZPRN; to all peers including that client)

 5. foreach client marked discarded
    6. remove that client from peer list

When we learned a route to a host, we send a
  ZPRN: add route notify packet
    with
      hops = hops for the first router
      dstip = destination host
    to
      all peers except the first router (split horizon)
