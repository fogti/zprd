NOTES about ZPRD peer communication, ordered by version:

0.0.3:

  We switched from TCP to UDP (lesser overheader, 20 bytes -> 8 bytes for transport).
  In the new version, we silently register new clients,
  and we discard them after a timeout (no data from peer since 15 minutes).

0.1.2:

  In this version, we silently register new clients, and we discard
  them after a timeout (no data from peer since 10 minutes).

  When we discard a client, we use the following algorithm:

   1. mark the client as discarded

   2. foreach route with a discarded client as router
      3. delete route
      4. send delete route notify packet (ZPRN; to all peers including that client)

   5. foreach client marked discarded
      6. remove that client from peer list

  When we learned a route to a host, we send a
    ZPRN: add route notify packet
      with
        hops = hops for the first router
        dstip = destination host
      to
        all peers except the first router (split horizon)

0.2.3:

  In this version, we don't re-calculate the IPv4 checksum,
  when we send packets between ZPRD hosts (via ZPRD).

  We only check the checksum on the entry-point
  (the host, where the packet entered thee tun device) and
  we only set the checksum on the exit-point
  (the host, where the packet leaves thee tun device).

0.2.5:

  In this version, we support IPv6 as underlying protocol below ZPRD (not enough tested).
